  <div class="question">
    <h2>4. How does responsive web design differ from traditional web design?</h2>
    <p>Answer:<br><br>Responsive web design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. Recent work also considers the viewer proximity as part of the viewing context as an extension for RWD. Content, design and performance are necessary across all devices to ensure usability and satisfaction. Traditionally, web designs were developed for fixed-width layouts that are optimized for a specific browser width. This created design and optimization work for a number of devices as people adopted devices with various resolutions in a website. However, responsive web design uses fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries, which are three main technical ingredients that allow web designs to adapt to the visitors’ device used to access the website.  </p>

  <div class="question">
    <h2>5.What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS? </h2>
    <p>Answer: <br><br>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol that we use to communicate with servers on the World Wide Web. It is insecure, which means that all information sent over it is unencrypted and could be intercepted. With HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), that data is encrypted by the SSL/TLS protocol , so that information sent over HTTPS is encrypted and secure. It is therefore much securer; partly because of the encryption, and partly because of the secure transmissions. This means that third parties can’t eavesdrop on information. A website that uses HTTPS:// is using information security.</p>
