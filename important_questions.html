    <p>Enhanced collaboration, communication, and access to information are among the many benefits for students who learn with Web 2.0 technologies. Tools like Google Docs make teamwork and partnering with a smaller group easier, while resources like Wikipedia can support a wide range of research activities. However, as we all know, the wealth of information on the Internet also provides an endless amount of opportunities for students to become distracted or to find misleading or incorrect data that impacts their productivity and the accuracy of their work, along with their academic integrity. 
    <br><br><br>
    Additionally, while Web 2.0 technology gives students a powerful platform, these tools can raise serious privacy and security issues as people of all ages create, share and work online.For educators to help maximize the positive impact of Web 2.0 technologies on their students' day-to-day work, they need to help their students develop a responsible level of proficiency in these toolsᅳproviding guidance in helping students know how to get the most from these tools, while helping them recognize when these tools are becoming a negative in either the accuracy of their work or their privacy and security. Both are important for not only the accomplishment of today's lesson, but as we increasingly hear from company executives and hiring managers, the skill they need to participate in tomorrow's workforce</p>
